## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# Read the URL.
url <- "http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/"

# Gather the html links present in the webpage.
links <- getHTMLLinks(url)

# Identify only the links which point to the JCMB 2015 files. 
filenames <- links[str_detect(links, "JCMB_2015")]

# Store the file names as a list.
filenames_list <- as.list(filenames)

# Create a function to download the files by passing the URL and filename list.
downloadcsv <- function (mainurl,filename) {
   filedetails <- str_c(mainurl,filename)
   download.file(filedetails,filename)
}

# Now apply the l_ply function and save the files into the current R working directory.
l_ply(filenames,downloadcsv,mainurl = "http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/")
```
