## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### 1. Data practice

In class we imported the survey data using the `read.table()` function. 

This is the code we used:

```{r}
survey <- read.table("survey_data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",") 

survey <- read.table("survey_mess.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",") 

```

##### (a) How many survey respondents are from MISM or Other?

```{r}
sum(survey[["Program"]] == "MISM" | survey[["Program"]] == "Other")
```

##### (b) What % of survey respondents are from PPM?

```{r}
100 * sum(survey[["Program"]] == "PPM") / nrow(survey)
```

#### 2. Index practice

##### (a) Use $ notation to pull the OperatingSystem column from the survey data

```{r}
survey$OperatingSystem
```

##### (b) Do the same thing with [,] notation, referring to OperatingSystem by name

```{r}
survey[, "OperatingSystem"]
```

##### (c) Repeat part (b), this time referring to OperatingSystem by column number

```{r}
survey[, 4]
```
