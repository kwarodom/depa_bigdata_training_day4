## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
# Elements are arranged sequentially by row.
M <- matrix(c(3:14), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)

# Elements are arranged sequentially by column.
N <- matrix(c(3:14), nrow = 4, byrow = FALSE)
print(N)

# Define the column and row names.
rownames = c("row1", "row2", "row3", "row4")
colnames = c("col1", "col2", "col3")

P <- matrix(c(3:14), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(rownames, colnames))
print(P)
```


```{r}
# Define the column and row names.
rownames = c("row1", "row2", "row3", "row4")
colnames = c("col1", "col2", "col3")

# Create the matrix.
P <- matrix(c(3:14), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(rownames, colnames))

# Access the element at 3rd column and 1st row.
print(P[1,3])

# Access the element at 2nd column and 4th row.
print(P[4,2])

# Access only the  2nd row.
print(P[2,])

# Access only the 3rd column.
print(P[,3])
```

```{r}
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 <- c(5,9,3)
vector2 <- c(10,11,12,13,14,15)

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
result <- array(c(vector1,vector2),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(result)
```

```{r}
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 <- c(5,9,3)
vector2 <- c(10,11,12,13,14,15)
column.names <- c("COL1","COL2","COL3")
row.names <- c("ROW1","ROW2","ROW3")
matrix.names <- c("Matrix1","Matrix2")

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
result <- array(c(vector1,vector2),dim = c(3,3,2),dimnames = list(row.names,column.names,
   matrix.names))
print(result)
```
```{r}
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 <- c(5,9,3)
vector2 <- c(10,11,12,13,14,15)

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
new.array <- array(c(vector1,vector2),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(new.array)

# Use apply to calculate the sum of the rows across all the matrices.
result <- apply(new.array, c(1), sum)
print(result)
```

```{r}
# Create a vector as input.
data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West","West","West","East","North")

print(data)
print(is.factor(data))

# Apply the factor function.
factor_data <- factor(data)

print(factor_data)
print(is.factor(factor_data))
```




```{r}
data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West","West","West","East","North")
# Create the factors
factor_data <- factor(data)
print(factor_data)

# Apply the factor function with required order of the level.
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)

```

```{r}
v <- gl(3, 4, labels = c("Tampa", "Seattle","Boston"))
print(v)
```

```{r}
chests <- c('gold', 'silver', 'gems', 'gold', 'gems')
types <- factor(chests)

print(chests)
print(types)

```
```{r}
weights <- c(300, 200, 100, 250, 150)
prices <- c(9000, 5000, 12000, 7500, 18000)
plot(weights, prices)

```
```{r}
chests <- c('gold', 'silver', 'gems', 'gold', 'gems')
types <- factor(chests)

weights <- c(300, 200, 100, 250, 150)
prices <- c(9000, 5000, 12000, 7500, 18000)
plot(weights, prices, pch=as.integer(types))

legend("topright", levels(types), pch=1:length(levels(types)))


```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
