## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
#### Plotting the Cars93 data

This problem uses the Cars93 dataset from the MASS package.

**(a)** Use `qplot` to create a scatterplot with Price on the y-axis and EngineSize on the `x-axis`.  

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
qplot(x = EngineSize, y = Price, data = Cars93)
```

**(b)** Repeat part (a) using the `ggplot` function and `geom_point()` layer.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price)) + geom_point()
```

**(c)** Repeat part (b), but this time specifying that the `color` mapping should depend on `Type` and the `shape` mapping should depend on `DriveTrain`.  

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price, colour = Type, shape = DriveTrain)) + geom_point()
```
# Create data for the graph.
x <-  c(21, 62, 10,53)
labels <-  c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai")

piepercent<- round(100*x/sum(x), 1)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city_percentage_legends.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x, labels = piepercent, main = "City pie chart",col = rainbow(length(x)))
legend("topright", c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai"), cex = 0.8,
   fill = rainbow(length(x)))

# Save the file.
dev.off()






Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
