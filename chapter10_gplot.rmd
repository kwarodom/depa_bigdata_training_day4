## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
weights <- c(300, 200, 100, 250, 150)
prices <- c(9000, 5000, 12000, 7500, 18000)
chests <- c('gold', 'silver', 'gems', 'gold', 'gems')
types <- factor(chests)

qplot(weights, prices, color = types)
```


```{r}
with(Cars93, plot(EngineSize, MPG.city)) # Base graphics qplot(x=EngineSize, y=MPG.city, data=Cars93) # using qplot from ggplot2

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
