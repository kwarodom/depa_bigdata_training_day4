This problem uses the Cars93 dataset from the MASS package.

(1)Use `qplot` to create a scatterplot with Price on the y-axis and EngineSize on the `x-axis`. 
qplot(x = EngineSize, y = Price, data = Cars93)

(2) Repeat part (a) using the `ggplot` function and `geom_point()` layer.
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price)) + geom_point()

(1)Repeat part (b), but this time specifying that the `color` mapping should depend on `Type` and the `shape` mapping should depend on `DriveTrain`.  
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price, colour = Type, shape = DriveTrain)) + geom_point()
